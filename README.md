ASxcel - Release 1.1
====================

ASxcel is a small tool for the browser game AirlineSim (www.airlinesim.aero) by simulogics. It
helps the player keep track of the routes he offers or plans to offer. Routes can be created
between airports, and additional parameters can be added to increase the degree of information
associated with it. For example to every airports its respective size, passenger and cargo can
be added, or the distance of a route can be entered.

But the application does not only allow the user to enter these information. He can also sort by
it, and schedule them. For a future version filtering by multiple parameters is planned, and the
graphical interface is merely a shadow of what it will be.

All this is designed to help the user make strategic decisions based on the information he collected
in the game world. And I sure hope it helps you, too!

Installation
------------

The program requires Java (JRE 1.7+), but after once you have installed Java just extract the .zip
archive to a place of your choice.

Usage
-----

First you have to create an enterprise. This is fairly straight forward, just enter a name (can be
anything, does not have to be the one from AirlineSim) and the place where your enterprise has its
main hub. Although this is not critical I advise you to take this step seriously because it will
greatly reduce the work you have to do when creating routes.

After your enterprise is created you need to add additional airports. This is because a route always
needs two end points, and right now you only have one. Please also notice that you not only need just
two, but two between no route already exists.

Once you have airports, you can create routes. Just choose the origin and destination, and voil√°. Now
the route gets displayed in the table, and you can start to adjust everything as much as you like. You
might notice the selection box at the end of every row: This is to indicate if a route is scheduled or
not.

Bugs
----

I'm sure as hell that this application contains quite an amount of bugs. If you see one, trample it to
death. Maybe it helps. If not, please open an issue on GitHub where the project is hosted:
